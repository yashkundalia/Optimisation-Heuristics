# About Optimization-Heuristics
This lab is about all the optimization techniques used in the industrial field. Different heuristics are used to scale down the complexity of the problem, along with getting an approximate solution, which is the tradeoff between the time for getting a good solution which cannot be computed fast.

* Travelling Salesman problem using (a) Tabu search (b) Simulated Annealing
* Maze problems which require exponential time, but gets reduced to polynomial time using approximation heurisitics
